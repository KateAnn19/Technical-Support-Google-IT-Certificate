CPU that is cooled by the heat sink 
The CPU is the brain of the computer 
The CPU does all the calculations and data processing
It comunicates to RAM (random access memory)
RAM is short-term memory
It is used to store data temporarily
Like typing something into a chat or a piece of text into a word processor 
Then there's the hard drive for storing long-term information
Then there's the motherboard
It holds everything in place and lets components talk to each other 
Then there's the power supply
It converts electricity from the wall into a form that the computer can use (DC)
All these components make up  most computers even a phone
The phone just uses a smaller version of these parts

Programs-tell computers what to do
CPU- does the things that the program tells to do
RAM-holds the information that the programs are giving to CPU so the CPU can work faster. This is faster than storing the information
into the hard drive.
The instructions to the CPU are written in binary 
The EDB (external data bus) carries the instructions around the computer (techincally a row of wires that interconnect parts of the computer)
When a voltage is sent to one of the wires you say that the state of the wire is on or 1   or it is off and 0
Bits physically travel around the computer with the EDB which comes in different sizes 8 bit, 16 bit, 32, even 64. 
When a CPU receives a byte it is stored on registers so the CPU can work with it. Even the answer is stored on registers
We don't send data from RAM over the EDB. This process happens with the MCC or memory controller chip. RAM has a shit ton of data and we need
to send it one byte at a time. CPU is connected to RAM through MCC
There's also and address bus which connects the CPU to the MCC and sends over the location of the data but not the data itself
The MCC then takes the address and looks for the data in RAM. Then the data is sent through the MCC to CPU
Cache can get data to CPU faster than RAM can L1 to L3. L1 is the smallest and fastest.
how does our CPU know when the set of instruction ends, and a new one begins?
CPU has an internal clock that keeps its operational in sync.
It connects to a special wire called Clock wire. When you send or receive data, it sends a voltage to that clock wire 
to let the CPU know it can start doing calculations. Think of our clock wires as the ticking of a clock. For every tick, 
the CPU does one cycle of operations. When you send a voltage to the clock wire, it's referred to as a clock cycle. 
If you have lots of data you need to process in a command. You need to run lots of clock cycles.
 3.4ghz, this number refers to the Clock speed of the CPU. Which is a maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle 
 in a set in a certain time period. 3.40 gigahertz is 3.4 billion cycles per second. That's super fast. But just because 
 it can run at this speed, doesn't mean it does. It just means that it can't exceed this number. Still, that number doesn't 
 stop some people from trying. There's a way you can exceed the number of clock cycles on your CPU on almost any device. 
 It's referred to as Overclocking and it increases the rate of your CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks. 
 This is commonly used to increase the performance in low-end CPUs. 
 
 Remember that transition book that I talked about in an earlier lesson? 
 The CPU uses this to translate and perform functions on our data. This transition book is called an instruction set, 
 which is literally just a list of instructions that our CPU is able to run. Functions like adding, subtracting, copying data 
 are all instructions that our CPU can carry out. Every single program on your computer, while extremely complex, is broken down
 into very small and simple instructions found in our instruction set. Instruction sets are hard-coded into our CPU. So different 
 CPU manufacturers may use different instructions sets. But they generally perform the same functions. 
 
 LGA or PGA (types of sockets connecting CPU to motherboard - make sure they're compatible)
 When we install our CPU, we need to do a few things to it to keep it cool. Since it does a lot of work, 
 it's prone to overheating. We have to make sure to include a heat sink, too, which takes the heat from our 
 CPU and dissipates it through a fan or another medium. There's one last thing I want to call out about CPUs. 
 If you purchase a CPU, you'll see that it has either a 32 bit or 64 bit architecture. What does that mean? Well, 
 we know we can't process 8 bits in binary. Now, imagine how we can process with 32 or even 64 bits. CPUs that have 
 32 bit or 64 bit architecture are just specifying how much data it can efficiently handle. You can read more about the 
 differences between 32 bit and 64 bit architecture in the next reading. For now, the main takeaway is that the CPU is one 
 of the most important parts of a computer.
 
 RAM
 We use RAM to store data that we want to access quickly. This data changes all the time so it isn't permanent. Almost 
 all RAM is volatile, which means that once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared. Remember that our 
 computer is comprised of programs. To run a program, we need to make a copy of it in RAM so our CPU can process it. When you 
 see a new phone or laptop that's says it has 16 gigs of RAM, that means it can run up to 16 gigs of programs, meaning you can 
 run lots of programs at the same time. 
 there are lots of types of RAM. And the one is commonly found in computers, 
 is DRAM or dynamic random access memory. Where a one or zero is sent to DRAM, it source each bit in a microscopic capacitor. 
 This is either the charge or discharge represented by one or zero. These semiconductors are put into chips that are on the RAM 
 and store our data. There are also different types of memory states that DRAM chips can be put on. The more modern DIMM sticks, 
 which usually stands for Dual Inline Memory Module, have different sizes of pins on them. I should call out, we don't really buy 
 RAM based on the number of DRAM chips they have. They are labeled by the capacity of RAM on a stake, like an 8 gig stick of RAM. 
 After DRAM was created, RAM manufacturers build something called SDRAM which stands for Synchronous DRAM. This type of RAM is 
 synchronized to our systems' clock speed allowing quicker processing of data. In today's system, we use another type of RAM, 
 called double data rate SDRAM, or DDR SDRAM for short. Most people refer to this RAM as DDR, even shorter. There were lots of 
 iterations of DDR, from DDR1, DDR2, DDR3 and now, DDR4. DDR is faster, takes up less power, and has a larger capacity than earlier 
 SDRAM versions. The latest version, DDR4, is the fastest type of short term memory currently available for your computer. And faster
 RAM means that programs can be run faster and that more programs can run at the same time. Keep in mind that any RAM sticks you use
 need a compatible motherboard with a different number of pins aligned with the motherboard RAM slots. Just like with the CPU, make
 sure that your motherboard is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy.
