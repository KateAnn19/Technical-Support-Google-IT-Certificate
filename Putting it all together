CPU that is cooled by the heat sink 
The CPU is the brain of the computer 
The CPU does all the calculations and data processing
It comunicates to RAM (random access memory)
RAM is short-term memory
It is used to store data temporarily
Like typing something into a chat or a piece of text into a word processor 
Then there's the hard drive for storing long-term information
Then there's the motherboard
It holds everything in place and lets components talk to each other 
Then there's the power supply
It converts electricity from the wall into a form that the computer can use (DC)
All these components make up  most computers even a phone
The phone just uses a smaller version of these parts
