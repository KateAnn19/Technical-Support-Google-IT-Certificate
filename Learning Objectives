- Technical Support Fundamentals 

8 bits = 1 byte
each byte can store 1 character and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system (2*8)

Computer is cut into 4 layers 
1) hardware
-port = connection point that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer 
cpu = central processing unit - brain of computer - does all the calculations and data processing   communicates with 
RAM = random access memory (computer's short-term memory)
Hard drive = holds all data we want to keep which includes pictures and music and applications
motherboard = holds all components in place and allows the parts to communicate with each other 
power supply

programs = instructions that tell computers what to do 
we store programs on durable media like hard drives (recipes in cookbooks are like apps stored on a hard drive) 

External Data Bus (EDB) wires that send the data - binary is sent through these 

Registers (inside CPU) - let us store the data that the CPU works with 

Memory controller chip (MCC) is a bridge between the CPU and the RAM

Address Bus connects CPU to the MCC and sends over the location of the data but not the data itself. MCC takes the address and 
looks for the data. Then the data is sent over the EDB.

RAM isn't the fastest way to get data to the CPU for processing 

Cache does. It is smaller than RAM but let's us store data that we you use most often and let's us quickly reference it. RAM is like a fridge 
full of food. It's easy to get into but it takes a little bit of time. Cache is like food in our pockets. Used to store recently or 
frequently accessed data.

there are 3 levels 

L1, L2, and L3    L1 is the smallest and fastest 

How does a CPU know when one set of instructions end and a new one begins? 
- clock wire 

overclocking tries to speed up the clock cycles but can overheat your GPU

CPU manufacturers or chipsets 

-QUALCOMM
-Intel
-AMD

CPU has to be compatible with the motherboard 
-LGA- Land Grid Array 
- PGA- Pin Grid Array

CPU is purchased with a 32 bit or 64 bit architecture (see supplemental readings for more info about difference)

heat sink keeps computer from overheating

There are lots of types of RAM 

DRAM

2) software
3) operating system
4) users
