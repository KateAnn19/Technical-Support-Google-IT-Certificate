8 bits = 1 byte
each byte can store 1 character and we can have 256 possible values thanks to the base-2 system (2*8)

Computer is cut into 4 layers 
1) hardware
-port = connection point that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer 
cpu = central processing unit - brain of computer - does all the calculations and data processing   communicates with 
RAM = random access memory (computer's short-term memory)
Hard drive = holds all data we want to keep which includes pictures and music and applications
motherboard = holds all components in place and allows the parts to communicate with each other 
power supply

programs = instructions that tell computers what to do 
we store programs on durable media like hard drives (recipes in cookbooks are like apps stored on a hard drive) 

External Data Bus (EDB) wires that send the data - binary is sent through these 

Registers (inside CPU) - let us store the data that the CPU works with 

Memory controller chip (MCC) is a bridge between the CPU and the RAM

Address Bus connects CPU to the MCC and sends over the location of the data but not the data itself. MCC takes the address and 
looks for the data. Then the data is sent over the EDB.

RAM isn't the fastest way to get data to the CPU for processing 

Cache does. It is smaller than RAM but let's us store data that we you use most often and let's us quickly reference it. RAM is like a fridge 
full of food. It's easy to get into but it takes a little bit of time. Cache is like food in our pockets. Used to store recently or 
frequently accessed data.

there are 3 levels 

L1, L2, and L3    L1 is the smallest and fastest 

How does a CPU know when one set of instructions end and a new one begins? 
- clock wire 

overclocking tries to speed up the clock cycles but can overheat your GPU

CPU manufacturers or chipsets 

-QUALCOMM
-Intel
-AMD

CPU has to be compatible with the motherboard 
-LGA- Land Grid Array 
- PGA- Pin Grid Array

CPU is purchased with a 32 bit or 64 bit architecture (see supplemental readings for more info about difference)

heat sink keeps computer from overheating

There are lots of types of RAM 

DRAM - type of RAM - stores each bit in a microscopic capacitor (this is either the charge or discharge represented by 1's and 0's). These 
semi-conductors are put into chips that are on the RAM and store our data. There are different types of memory states that DRAM chips can
be put on. More modern DIMM sticks (dual inline memory module) (have different sizes of pins on them). We don't buy RAM based on the number
of DRAM chips they have. RAM sticks have to be compatible with mother board. My computer uses VRAM

Motherbaords 
-made of two chipsets 
** Northbridge (interconnects RAM and video cards **Southbridge (maintains IO or input/output controllers like harddrives and USB devices)
some modern CPUs directly integrate the Northbridge into the CPU so there isn't a seperate chipset 

CPU data and peripherals (mouse, keyboard, monitor) are managed by the chipset 

Expansion slots allow users to increase a computer's functionality 

The PCI is the standard for an expansion slot. Express or Peripheral Component Interconnect Express. A PCIe bus looks like a slot on the 
motherboard. and a PCIe base expansion card looks like a smaller circuit board. 

Form factor - there are different sizes of motherboards available today. These sizes of form factors determine the amount of stuff we can
put in it and the amount of space we'll have. 

ATX (advanced technology eXtended) (comes in different sizes) is the most common form factor for motherboards. If you don't want to use an ATX you can use an ITX (information
technology eXtended form factor). The ITX is smaller than the ATX. The form factor plays a role into what expansion slots you might want to use.

Data Sizes :
-smallest unit of data storage is a bite
- 8 bits = 1 byte 
1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte(kb)
1024 kbs = 1 megabyte(mb)
1024 megabytes = 1 gigabyte(gb)
1024 gb's = 1 terabyte

there are 2 types of hard drives
1) hard disks (hdd) (rpm is the revolution per minute - basically the speed in which data is read and written) 
a hard drive with a higher RPM is faster. HDDs are prone to damage because there are a lot of moving parts. This susceptibility to damage 
went away with a new type of drive called an SSD (solid state drive). SSD's have no moving parts. 
-there are also hybrid SSD's and HDD's 

2) there are a few interfaces that the hard drives use to connect to connect to our system. ATA interfaces are the most common ones.
Most popular ATA is serial ATA or SATA which uses one cable for data transfers. SATA drives are hot swappable (you don't have to turn off your
machine to plug in a SATA drive) but SATAs haven't been able to keep up with faster and faster SSDs so a new interface standards were created
called NVM express or NVMe. Instead of using a cable to connect your drive to your machine the drive was added as an expansion slot which 
allows for greater throughput of data and increased efficiency 

Computers have a power supply that converts electricity from your volt to something useful.
There are 2 types - DC (direct current) and AC (alternating current which changes direction all the time). Computers use DC so the power supply
in the computer converts AC from the power company. Our power supply converts the AC from the wall into low voltage DC power that we can use and
transmit throughout the computer.

Most power supply units have a fan. They also have voltage information and cables to power motherboard and a power cable.

The amount of electricity coming out is called current or (amperage) and it's measured in amps. Amps pull electricity and volts push 
electricity. Amps will pull as much electricity as is needed and volts will give you everything.

The back of a device charger may have a 1 or 2.1a. A 2.1a (2.1 amps) will charge a device faster).

Wattage - the amount of volts and amps a device needs
